# ImageCluster
Image Clustering via DBScan inspired algorithm (IMLP4)


# HOW TO USE

You can run this by any means, as long as it creates the HTML page and injects the javascript.

Here is how I did it:

Using VSCode, go to the code and ensure you have the "liveServer" vscode extension enabled.

Then, near the bottom right hand corner, there should be an option to "Go Live", which should redirect you to a local host.

**When On The Local Host:**

Upload an IMAGE (.png, .jpeg, etc.) using the upload button. Then, change EPSILON to your liking (0-255 are the only values that matter, 40 is recommended and is default). This determined the maximum color distance two adjacent pixels must be for them to be clustered together. Once ready, press **submit**, and the algorithm will operate on the image.
